General TODO
8/28/15

- move generic DNS lemmas to QueryStructures
- pull out big ideas from tuples_in_relation_satisfy_constraint_specific
- Comp in predicate: relation-building query notation
- Fiat wishlist (tuples, monads, etc.)
- authoritative server needs to be patched for packet changes
  (in progress, honeDns fails)
- fill in stubs
- pass rep around properly in process
- Filter rows by record type and class
- Bounded amount of work (delete a referral in SLIST when queried too many times)
- Returning all answer/authority/additional instead of just one (re-hierarchizing rows into packet)
- Proper SBELT IP
- Dealing with CNAME; requires FueledFix
- CNAME in answers and having that as the answer for the domain and the aliases (see RFC 1034, 6.2.7)
- Inverse queries
- variant types for cache pointers
- caching opportunity with SLIST_ORDER (remove table, compute order whenever needed -> generate table)
- TTL optimization?
- put constraints back on tables
- wrapper: time monad
- Fiat schema/tuple autocomplete (Emacs hacking)
- Parallelism (long term research goal)
- Coq clippy thing
